        "text": "<p>I started writing code back in middle school as a hobby and it quickly turned into a passion of mine. Beginning with websites, I gained more and more knowledge about programming until I was able to develop my first native application on iOS, Service Day. I pride myself on learning new things and try to preserve the same spirit that drove me to become a self-taught developer. At the same time I have gained a deeper understanding of hardware technologies and IT concepts. It brings me satisfaction to help others find solutions to their tech troubles, and I still take time to help close friends and relatives find their way through software and hardware issues, though much of it is remote nowadays.</p><p>I am currently searching for part-time work or internship opportunities related to iOS or web development or the IT field. I have foundational experience with a wide range of technologies and am eager to build on my skills. My desired position is one where I can hone my skills, learn from more experienced developers or technicians, while proving to be an asset to your team. Thank you for your consideration.</p>"
